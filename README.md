**Inspiration**

I'm not trying to be original with this project I know 
better projects exit and do this better but this is mine. 
If you look NASA's dedicated page looks its very close to 
what I made. https://apod.nasa.gov

I do plan on making this into a docker image so it can
be hosted. Just one thing at a time.
